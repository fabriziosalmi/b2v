# Recommended Platforms

To ensure legal compliance and true data ownership, we recommend using `b2v` with self-hosted or decentralized video platforms. Here are the best Open Source candidates to "close the loop" safely.

## 1. PeerTube (Self-Hosted)
[PeerTube](https://joinpeertube.org/) is a decentralized video hosting network based on ActivityPub.
- **Why**: You can host your own instance on a VPS (DigitalOcean, Hetzner, etc.).
- **Pros**: Full control over data, Federation support, Modern UI.
- **Usage**: Upload your `b2v` videos to your private or unlisted channel.

## 2. Nextcloud
[Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/) is the industry standard for self-hosted cloud storage.
- **Why**: It treats video files as first-class citizens.
- **Pros**: Integrated with file storage, huge ecosystem.
- **Usage**: Store `.mkv` files directly or use the "Media" app.

## 3. Jellyfin / Emby
[Jellyfin](https://jellyfin.org/) is a Free Software Media System.
- **Why**: Designed to organize and stream video.
- **Pros**: Completely free, no tracking, works on any server.
- **Usage**: Point Jellyfin to your backup folder and stream your data "backups" locally or remotely.

## 4. Decentralized Networks (IPFS / LBRY / Odysee)
- **IPFS**: InterPlanetary File System. True immutable storage.
- **LBRY/Odysee**: Blockchain-based content distribution.
- **Note**: While decentralized, ensure you are not violating "spam" or "abuse" policies of public gateways.
